# Pathology Scheduling App
This is the backend business logic for my project to help my mom schedule times for her department.
The problem: they do their scheduling by hand. This can get tedious if someone needs to last minute reschedule.
The solution: automate the scheduling!

The goal is to keep endpoints to a minimum, and keep frontend calls as simple as possible. 
Ultimately, this will be wrapped up in a Wails app.
